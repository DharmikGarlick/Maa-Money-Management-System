For our OOP-1 JAVA GUI Project we have decided to create a money and gorcery management system for mothers around the world. There are times that mothers send their children, significant other or others to go shopping.
The issue arises with keeping a list of groceries and transactions in mind. From a cultural perspective of Bangladesh, parents feel reluctant to let their children keep/spend the change from shopping to use themselves.
Now not everyone may be using the spare money for good/bad but there is no harm in keeping track of the money.
Hence, this system was created to keep an accurate record of all items and transactions so that bookkeeping gets much easier and allowing us to focus more of our time on other things.
(Maa-Money is a play of words that sounds like Mamoni which is a cute title given only to mothers and worthy aunties)
